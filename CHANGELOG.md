# Changelog

## 0.0.1

This package is useful for simple animations for widgets. You can just wrap any widget with it and expect it to transition on build to it's position.
You can also play around with it's parameters to change it's duration, direction, scale factors, etc. I will be adding other simple animations in the future.
